# WEB102-San-Diego-Top-Spots

![](images/ProjectScreenshot.png)

Third project in my time at San Diego Code School, this one integrates a data.json file into a table
through jquery and javascript. Added some minimal styling with sass and a local express server later
on.

## Please feel free to demo the project by taking these steps..
```
Clone or fork the repo
```
```
npm install
```
```
npm start
```
```
Open your browser to view on localhost: 3000
```
